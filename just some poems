You are of course mistaken
you always do that thing
softly wipe the brow
then cut away the sling

underneath the pillow
bread and butter fall
softly shake the pillow
either in or out

where in lies the end of days
a heart beat slowly strays
a yearling under coat
and moth is dust full out

rendering each classic verse
slowly pieced and said
order now your classic heart
the person is not yet

shoulder to cry on
shoulder to die on
and then a tear drops
gone

sound escapes me
anger envelopes me
all i am left with is 
husk







Thank you coca cola
thank you tesco clubcard
thank you mother nature
for reminding me each day

oil of ulay gives me hope
a poem in the sun
thank you ford and thank you mars
creme eggs and kinder too

billboard taxi rank taxi
thank you mitsubishi
thank you
